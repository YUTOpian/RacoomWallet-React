// --- PIN-based encryption for encryptedSecret/encryptedMnemonic --------------------------
//
// The PIN the person types (4-6 raw digits) is never used directly as an AES key/passphrase.
// It's first stretched through PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with a random per-secret salt and a high
// iteration count, so an attacker who extracts the encrypted blob from IndexedDB still has
// to brute-force the PIN through 210,000 PBKDF2 rounds per guess rather than a single cheap
// AES decrypt - closing the gap described in the security review above (a raw 4-6 digit
// keyspace is otherwise exhaustible almost instantly). This uses the browser's native
// Web Crypto API (SubtleCrypto) rather than crypto-js's pure-JS PBKDF2: crypto-js took
// ~2 seconds for one derivation at this iteration count in testing (would mean a
// multi-second freeze on every PIN unlock/send/backup), while SubtleCrypto's native
// implementation does the same work in the low tens of milliseconds. AES-GCM (authenticated
// encryption) also replaces AES-CBC here, so a wrong PIN fails the auth tag immediately
// instead of relying on "did this decrypt to plausible-looking UTF-8?" as a proxy.
//
// New format (written by every encryptString call from now on):
//   "v2:" + base64(salt) + ":" + base64(iv) + ":" + base64(ciphertext+authTag)
// Old format (still readable, never written): CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(message, pin).toString()
//   - i.e. CryptoJS's own passphrase mode (EVP_BytesToKey/MD5, embedded salt, AES-CBC).
//   Kept decryptable so wallets created before this change don't lose their secret/
//   mnemonic; they're transparently upgraded to the new format the next time
//   encryptSecret() runs (Settings > PIN変更 flow), since that always re-encrypts through
//   encryptString().
