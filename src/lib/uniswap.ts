/**
 * Uniswap V4 swap support.
 *
 * V4 replaces V3's "one contract per pool" model with a singleton design: every pool's state
 * lives inside one PoolManager contract, pools are identified by a PoolKey (currency0, currency1,
 * fee, tickSpacing, hooks) rather than a deployed address, and swaps are executed through the
 * Universal Router (which talks to PoolManager on the caller's behalf) instead of a dedicated
 * SwapRouter. Unlike V3, native ETH/POL/AVAX is represented directly inside a pool as the zero
 * address - there's no wrapped-native token to route through, so no wrap/unwrap step is needed
 * anywhere in this file. ERC-20 inputs are pulled via Permit2 rather than a plain ERC-20
 * allowance directly on the router, which is why ensurePermit2Allowance below is a two-step
 * approval (wallet -> Permit2, then Permit2 -> Universal Router) instead of V3's one-step
 * approve(). This migration matters in practice, not just architecturally: as of mid-2026 JPYC's
 * most liquid on-chain pairs (JPYC/USDC on Ethereum, Polygon and Avalanche) sit in V4 pools, with
 * V3 liquidity for the same pairs largely dried up - see the deployment addresses below and the
 * function docs for how the JPYC-hub routing this file already did for V3 carries over unchanged.
 *
 * PoolManager/V4Quoter/UniversalRouter addresses are sourced from Uniswap's own deployments
 * listing (https://developers.uniswap.org/deployments) and are per-chain rather than shared -
 * unlike V3's CREATE2-deterministic addresses, V4 has NOT been deployed at the same address on
 * every chain, so (as before) each is looked up per-chain rather than assumed to match. Permit2
 * is the one exception - Uniswap and most of the ecosystem share a single canonical Permit2
 * deployment at the same address on every EVM chain.
 * Uniswap has no official V4 deployment on Kaia, so - exactly as with V3 before it - swapping is
 * intentionally unsupported there: isSwapSupported() below is the single gate every swap entry
 * point (Home, SwapTop, SwapConfirmation) checks before allowing the flow to proceed, and the
 * pool manager/quoter/router addresses are simply never resolved for any other chain.

/**
 * Executes a swap of `amountIn` of tokenIn for tokenOut via the Universal Router's V4_SWAP
 * command, granting the router Permit2 access first if tokenIn is an ERC-20 with insufficient
 * allowance (native-in swaps skip this entirely - the router receives native currency directly
 * via msg.value and settles it from its own balance, with no approval of any kind needed).
 * amountOutMinimum is derived from `quote` and `slippageBps` (basis points, e.g. 100 = 1%) to
 * protect against price movement between quoting and broadcast.
 *
 * A v4 swap is built as a short sequence of "actions" rather than a single function call: one
 * SWAP_EXACT_IN_SINGLE per hop, followed by one SETTLE_ALL (pay for the input) and one TAKE_ALL
 * (collect the output) - see the Actions/ACTION_* constants above. When `quote.route` is set
 * (see fetchSwapQuote), there's no direct pool for this pair, so two SWAP_EXACT_IN_SINGLE
 * actions are chained back to back instead of one: the second hop's amountIn is passed as
 * OPEN_DELTA (0), which tells V4Router to use whatever the first hop actually produced rather
 * than a fixed amount decided ahead of time. Because v4's flash accounting only nets everything
 * out at the very end, this settles in one atomic transaction exactly like V3's packed multi-hop
 * path did - the wallet never actually holds the intermediate USDT/USDC, and only the final
 * TAKE_ALL's amountOutMinimum needs to enforce the person's slippage tolerance.
